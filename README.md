# Azure Function Test

Test dependency injection of IHttpClientFactory to Azure function.

This is based on the instruction of [Use dependency injection in .NET Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-dependency-injection).

See a question in SO: [FileNotFoundException when starting Azure Function project which uses dependency injection of IHttpClientFactory locally](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75539433/filenotfoundexception-when-starting-azure-function-project-which-uses-dependency/)
